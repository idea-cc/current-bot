# current-bot
A bot made with Discord InteraKTions and Kord, made for the purpose of modularity and ease of use. 

# Why?
Well, for starters, most bots, if not all, are pretty niche in some specific areas:

* Mee6 is terrible unless you throw money at it. Most of the features can be replaced by other well made bots, but even 
then I do not recommend using it. Automod has been added to most libraries, making it so most features are redundant at best.
* Fire is a really good bot, but there are some questionable features, and it uses Discord.js.
* Most Discord bots are really for profit, making it hard to choose between all performance or all profits.
* Sometimes, you don't want multiple bots within a single server, and most of them are unoptimized.a

For that reason, we decided to make our own Discord bot, using the Kord Library. However, we had to either choose between:

* Making our own command parser 
  * More effort, but in general, it looks better
* Using another library
  * Kord-Extensions
  * Discord InteraKTions
  * DiscordKt
  * KFox

For the most part, we decided to use Kord-Extension for the original creation of the bot, but then decided to switch to 
Discord Interaktions, as it was found to be more pleasant to look at, as well as being a lot more modular.
